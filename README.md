<h1>Check Your Redirects and Statuscode</h1>
<h2>Redirect HTTP tracing</h2>
This tool illustrates the path of where a link actually leads and which servers are accessed before you get to the page you thought you originally had requested.

You can also use it to test your links generated with bit.ly or similar short link services to verify that your redirects all work properly.

<h2>Why are links being redirected?</h2>
Redirecting links or URLs can have many purposes. In theory they are used to tell anybody who requests a page that the content they are looking for has moved to another location. Currently their main use is to record, track and analyse clicks and hits for statistics. This is both true for email marketing, social networks and other media where a user is exposed to links.

<h2>What are HTTP status codes?</h2>
The numbers that show up in the coloured boxes are the HTTP status codes that tell a browser or anything that requests a URL what the status of that address / resource is. If it's 200, everything is fine and the page will now be served. If it's 301, 302 or some others, a redirect will happen.

<h2>Most common HTTP status codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>200 - OK</li>
<li>301 - Moved Permanently</li>
<li>302 - Found</li>
<li>307 - Temporary Redirect</li>
<li>400 - Bad Request</li>
<li>401 - Unauthorized</li>
<li>403 - Forbidden</li>
<li>404 - Not Found</li>
<li>410 - Gone</li>
<li>500 - Internal Server Error</li>
</ul>
